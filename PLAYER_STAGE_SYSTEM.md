## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Hexagonal Grid Generation**
```typescript
private generateHexGrid(): void {
    for (let row = 0; row < this.mapHeight; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < this.mapWidth; col++) {
            const tile: HexTile = {
                x: col,
                y: row,
                type: this.determineTileType(),
                discovered: false,
                cleared: false
            };
        }
    }
}
```

### **Turn-Based Combat Logic**
```typescript
private executeAction(action: CombatAction): void {
    if (this.combatState.playerActionPoints >= action.actionPoints) {
        this.combatState.playerActionPoints -= action.actionPoints;
        this.applyActionEffects(action);
        this.switchToEnemyTurn();
    }
}
```

### **Zone Progression System**
```typescript
private getUnlockedZones(): string[] {
    const zoneProgression: Record<string, string[]> = {
        'heart': ['lungs'],
        'lungs': ['brain'],
        'brain': ['liver'],
        // ... more zones
    };
    return zoneProgression[this.zone] || [];
}
```
