- Real-time game time tracking
- Improved visual hierarchy and spacing
- Better accessibility with proper text styling
- Container-based organization for easy management

### 4. Game Scene Integration
**Updated**: `src/scenes/Game.ts`

**Integration Features**:
- ✅ Complete GameHUD integration
- ✅ Real-time UI updates
- ✅ Player and enemy visual effects
- ✅ Proper game state management
- ✅ Enhanced collision detection
- ✅ Improved game flow

## Technical Improvements

### Visual Effects System
- **Shield Effects**: Animated circular shields with pulsing animations

- `SettingsScreen.tsx` → Phaser scene
- `TutorialScreen.tsx` → Phaser scene
- `GameOverScreen.tsx` → Phaser scene
- `PauseOverlay.tsx` → Phaser overlay
- `PowerUp.tsx` → Phaser entity
- `ParticleSystem.tsx` → Phaser particle system

### 2. Advanced Features
- Shape recognition system for special abilities
- Drawing path functionality
- Combo system enhancements
- Achievement system
- Sound and music management
- Settings persistence

### 3. Mobile Optimization
- Touch controls implementation
